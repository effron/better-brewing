Welcome to Better Brewing
=========================

Purpose
-------
Better Brewing is a place for beer homebrewers to improve their craft by helping them keep track of their recipes, individual brews, and help them pinpoint issues which may cause off flavors in the final product.

Use
---
Sign up at [Better Brewing](http://better-brewing.herokuapp.com) to get started! Once logged in, you can either upload your own recipe from any recipe software that can export BeerXML(most recipe software), or find and clone a recipe uploaded by another user.

Better Brewing walks you through the brew process, prompting you to take consistent and complete brew notes. After one brew, you can see the automatically organized notes, and add post brew-day notes too, including fermentation checks and detailed tasting notes.

After a couple of brews, you can compare your brew day notes and tasting notes. Better Brewing converts your notes into easy-to-read charts to help you see what changed between brews, and why. Use this new knowledge to help you improve the recipe and brew better beer!
