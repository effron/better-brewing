##TODO

More AJAX SPINNERS:
brew note show page: adding row, updating row, update bottling notes, update fermentation ntoes. Probably abstract this into library, give things specific class if they need to have ajax spinners added to them.

Use Order by to sort recipes in index

###brew day experience
Add timers
Add checklists
Overall notes:
  Each page has a text area to type overall notes. Submit it on each step, but then repopulate it with the info it already had. Make it nice looking somehow?

Brew notes overlay chart: combine all charts to more easily compare brews!

Link the messages to add mash and fermenting notes to somewhere to actially do it

####Friends

####Future:
Ajaxy pagination
