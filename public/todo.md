Brew Notes:
Change "BREW ME" button to "CLONE ME" button if not your recipe.
Don't let user create notes for recipes that they don't own.
Figure out how to make sure you can only create note for the correct recipe context

Add associations to sub-notes

Style brewnote view and index

Maybe give notes a title?

Create subtemplate for brew note index for current user context or recipe context.
Something like display the recipe title and date for current user, or just the date for recipe context
