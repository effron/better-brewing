##TODO

###Tasting notes:

Add more fields to tasting notes view

###Recipes:

Add methods to get detailed information out of ingredients
  Something like, click on ingredient name, view pops in that shows all the data on that ingredient
    Need to create an ingredient show view partial probably for each type of ingredient. DO IT
    
Clean up ingredient display (round numbers, convert units(?))

###Brew Notes:

Add unit information (maybe process info so that they can be stored as integers)
  Make it so that unit is greyed out in background of input?
  
Add sparge notes and mash volume to compare notes page?

Refine UJS experience.

Brew notes overlay chart: combine all charts to more easily compare brews!
